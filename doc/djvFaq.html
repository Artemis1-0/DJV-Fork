<a name="1"><h2>Is DJV free?</h2></a>
<p>The DJV source code is covered by an open source BSD style license. This
means that DJV is essentially free to use, modify, and distribute. Note however
that some of the third party software that DJV depends on may have different
licensing requirements. See the legal page for more details
<a href="djvLegal.html">here</a>.</p>

<a name="2"><h2>How do I setup the DJV command line tools?</h2></a>
<p>See the downloads page <a href="djvDownloads.html">here</a>.
</p>

<a name="3"><h2>How do I use a LUT (lookup table) with the DJV viewer?</h2></a>
<p>\todo</p>
 
<a name="4"><h2>Are 3D LUTs supported?</h2></a>
<p>Unfortunately 3D LUTs are not currently supported.</p>

<a name="5"><h2>How can I convert an image sequence to a movie?</h2></a>
<p>Either the DJV viewer or the command line tools can be used to perform the
conversion.</p>
<p>To use the viewer to perform the conversion, first open the image sequence
you would like to convert. Then choose "Save" from the "File" menu and enter
the name of the movie with a file extension like ".mov". Click the "Ok" button
and a dialog will appear showing the progress of the conversion.</p>
<p>To use the command line tools to perform the conversion, run the command
"djv_convert" from a terminal with arguments similar to this:
<pre>
> djv_convert input.1-100.sgi output.mov
</pre>

<a name="6"><h2>How can I convert a movie to an image sequence?</h2></a>
<p>The steps are similar to the above question.</p>
<p>When specifying the name of the output image sequence you only need to use
the first frame, the other frames will be generated automatically. For
example:</p>
<pre>
> djv_convert input.mov output.1.sgi
</pre>

<a name="7"><h2>What image and movie file formats are supported?</h2></a>
<p>See the image I/O page located <a href="djvImageIo.html">here.</a></p>

<a name="8"><h2>How can I change the timecode display to frames?</h2></a>
<p>Open the preferences dialog from the "File" menu and click on "Miscellaneous"
in the "General" section. Set the time units to "Frames".</p>
