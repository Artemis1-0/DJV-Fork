<h3>Testimonials</h3>

<p>In our daily business at unexpected, we are constantly
checking and reviewing hundreds of rendered frames in lots of file formats,
sizes and situations. DJV is the one tying all of our 3d- and
vfx-production-processes together, no matter what format in which type of
project. Its fast loading, ease to use and stability is key to visual
communication in our daily work since years.</p>

<p>In 2010, I worked on my first 4K in color grading and printing
to film. I was not able to do it if DJV view doesn't exist to check final
picture in DPX. In this time, the max playback rate was about 13/fps. In 2015,
I can playback with this very great tool 4K cinema ( 4096x2304 ) @ 25/fps on a
true 4K display. I built my workflow with DJV view in a very important function:
It makes me able to check the final image that will be encoded in DCP with
normal playback. Thank you very much to the author.</p>
