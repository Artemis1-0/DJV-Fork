    <p class="quote">In our daily business at unexpected, we are constantly
    checking and reviewing hundreds of rendered frames in lots of file formats,
    sizes and situations. DJV is the one tying all of our 3d- and vfx-production
    processes together, no matter what format in which type of project. Its
    fast loading, ease to use and stability is key to visual communication in
    our daily work since years.</p>

    <p class="quote">In 2010, I worked on my first 4K in color grading and
    printing to film. I was not able to do it if DJV view doesn't exist to
    check final picture in DPX. In this time, the max playback rate was about
    13/fps. In 2015, I can playback with this very great tool 4K cinema
    (4096x2304) @ 25/fps on a true 4K display. I built my workflow with DJV view
    in a very important function: It makes me able to check the final image that
    will be encoded in DCP with normal playback. Thank you very much to the author.</p>

    <p class="quote">At GPS we use more involved solutions for advanced and remote client reviews
	and dailies but there's a lot to be said about a small lightweight frame viewer.
	And DJV does a great job at it. The fact that is open source, with a full set
	of codec libraries, portable and fully cross-platform makes a very easy
	decision when adopting it as a default tool for artists to review their work
	with. Its command-line implementation made it seamless to integrate it with our
	pipeline. We have it integrated in our main proprietary software hub and
	through it we have also embedded DJV inside other 2D and 3D solutions we use.</p>

    <p class="quote">The DJV Imaging suite of tools are the backbone of our transcoding pipeline.
	Hundreds of input plates and renders pass through DJV in our facility on a
	weekly basis without a hitch. The DJV suite of tools also integrate nicely
	throughout our scripting pipeline making it easy to build custom tools for our
	producers, artists and supervisors for publishing dailies, transcoding and
	reviewing footage. I am constantly amazed at its performance and value in our
	pipeline. If you're looking for a way to improve your pipeline DJV imaging
	should be a top consideration.</p>

    <p class="quote">We use DJV Viewer here at Frantic Films for playing flipbooks, QuickTimes,
	and raw 2k+ renders across the network. It has a nice uncluttered UI,
	customizable keys, and its robust tools have fantastic options for anyone
	needing a strong RAM player. It's ability to write out proxy footage is a
	valuable tool and it allows us to quickly get artists up and running precomps
	or doing matchmoves. I'd have to give this program an 11 out of 10 for
	usability.</p>

    <p class="quote">I would like to thank you for the excellent DJV image viewing application
	you have developed. The quality of this product, combined with your willingness
	to implement new features and the speed in which you implement these features
	has made this an indispensable tool in our QA pipeline. This application easily
	rivals other commercial tools.</p>
