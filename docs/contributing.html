    <p>For new features consider creating an issue on
    <a class="text" href="https://github.com/darbyjohnston/DJV/issues">GitHub</a>
    to provide an opportunity for discussion and feedback about the
    proposed changes.</p>
    <p>The following steps describe an example workflow for contributing
    code to DJV.</p>
    <p>Fork the DJV repository using the GitHub website and clone it
    to your local machine:</p>
    <pre>
git clone https://github.com/you/DJV.git djv
cd djv</pre>
    <p>Add the DJV repository as an upstream to keep your source code
    up to date:</p>
    <pre>
git remote add upstream https://github.com/darbyjohnston/DJV.git</pre>
    <p>Create a new branch for your work:</p>
    <pre>
git checkout -b mychange upstream/master</pre>
    <p>Fetch and merge the latest changes:</p>
    <pre>
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master</pre>
    <p>Follow the build instructions for
    <a class="text" href="build_linux.html">Linux</a>,
    <a class="text" href="build_osx.html">Apple macOS</a>, or
    <a class="text" href="build_windows.html">Microsoft Windows</a>.</p>
    <p>When making your change please follow the coding convention and
    style of the file you are working in.</p>
    <p>Once the change is ready create a pull request on GitHub. Use the
    git rebase and squash functionality to keep the change as clean as
    possible.</p>

    <p>The inital batch of translations for DJV has been machine generated
    which probably leads to some surprising text in the user interface,
    apologies in advance. Any help with fixing these translations is greatly
    appreciated, though unfortunately the workflow is still a bit complicated.</p>
    <p>If you are familiar with git the best way to contribute translations
    would be the same way as contributing code, however for people unfamilar
    with git the following workflow may also be used.</p>
    <p>Locate the translation files you want to edit on
    <a class="text" href="https://github.com/darbyjohnston/DJV/tree/master/etc/Text">GitHub</a>.
    Note that the translations are split across multiple files corresponding
    to the library or program they are located in.</p>
    <p>Download the files you want to edit and move them to either the DJV
    documents directory ($HOME/Documents/DJV), or a directory specified
    with the DJV_TEXT_PATH environment variable. These files will now override
    the default files installed with DJV.</p>
    <p>Start DJV and switch to your desired language in the settings. Open
    the text files in a UTF8 compatible text editor and start making changes.
    DJV will monitor the files and automatically reload them so you can see
    your changes interactively.</p>
    <p>When you are finished with your changes create an issue on
    <a class="text" href="https://github.com/darbyjohnston/DJV/issues">GitHub</a>
    and attach the files you have edited.</p>
