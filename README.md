# ![DJV Icon](etc/Icons/DJV_Icon_32.svg) DJV

DJV is an open source application for playback and review of image
sequences. DJV can playback high resolution image sequences in real
time, with audio, A/B comparison, and color management.

Features include:
* Support for high resolution and high bit depth images
* A/B comparison with wipe, overlay, and difference modes
* Timeline support with OpenTimelineIO
* Color management with OpenColorIO
* Multi-track audio with variable speed and reverse playback
* Experimental support for USD files
* Available for Linux, macOS, and Windows

[Documentation](https://darbyjohnston.github.io/DJV/index.html)

DJV is built with the [tlRender](https://github.com/darbyjohnston/tlRender) library.

## Downloads

**NOTE**: Download packages only include a minimal set of video codecs. To
enable full support for video codecs, either compile from source or replace
the FFmpeg shared library files.


## Building on Linux

Dependencies:
* CMake 3.31

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/darbyjohnston/DJV.git
```
Run CMake with the super build script:
```
cmake -S DJV/etc/SuperBuild -B Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$PWD/Release/install -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$PWD/Release/install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```
Start the build:
```
cmake --build Release -j 4 --config Release
```
Run the application:
```
./Release/DJV/src/DJV-build/bin/djv/djv
```


## Building on macOS

Dependencies:
* CMake 3.31

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/darbyjohnston/DJV.git
```
Run CMake with the super build script:
```
cmake -S DJV/etc/SuperBuild -B Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$PWD/Release/install -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$PWD/Release/install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```
Start the build:
```
cmake --build Release -j 4 --config Release
```
Run the application:
```
./Release/DJV/src/DJV-build/bin/djv/djv
```

The CMake variable `CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES` can be used to specify the build
architecture:
```
-DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=x86_64
```
```
-DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=arm64
```

These aliases are convenient for switching between architectures:
```
alias arm="env /usr/bin/arch -arm64 /bin/zsh --login"
alias intel="env /usr/bin/arch -x86_64 /bin/zsh --login"
```


## Building on Windows

Dependencies:
* CMake 3.31
* Install MSYS2 (https://www.msys2.org) for compiling FFmpeg.
* Install Strawberry Perl (https://strawberryperl.com/) for compiling network support.
* Install Python 3.11 for compiling USD.

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/darbyjohnston/DJV.git
```
Run CMake with the super build script:
```
cmake -S DJV\etc\SuperBuild -B Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=%CD%\Release\install -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=%CD%\Release\install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```
Start the build:
```
cmake --build Release -j 4 --config Release
```
Run the application:
```
set PATH=%CD%\Release\install\bin;%PATH%
```
```
.\Release\DJV\src\DJV-build\bin\djv\Release\djv
